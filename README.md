# weather_db_maint
Database maintenance tasks for the weather average temps project. It now performs the following actions:

-  Lists All Cities in Database
-  Add the subtables (Month, Fortnight, and Week) for selected cities
-  Drops these subtables for selected cities
-  Populates the subtables with the appropriate average values for the selected cities

It takes about 4 minutes per city to calculate all values between 1900 and 2024
